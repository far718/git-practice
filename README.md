# Practice repository to start learning Git

## Commands used

- git init: create a repository
- git status: compare working directory, staging area, and current branch
- git add: add changes from working directory to staging area
- git commit: commit changes from staging area to current branch
- git config: set or get configuration
- git log: show history of project commits

## Commit messages

- default editor is vim (this can be changed)
- `i` to enter *insert* mode
- type commit message
- `Esc` -> `:wq` -> `Enter` to write message and quit
or use `git commit -m "<message>"`

- First line should be clear, accurate, and concise
- use proper, spelling, grammar and punctuation
- don't end with a `.`
