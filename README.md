## Commands used

- git init: create a repository
- git status: compare working directory, staging area, and current branch

## Commit messages

- default editor is vim (this can be changed)
- `i` to enter *insert* mode
- type commit message
- `Esc` -> `:wq` -> `Enter` to write message and quit
or use `git commit -m "<message>"`

- First line should be clear, accurate, and concise
- use proper, spelling, grammar and punctuation
- don't end with a `.`
